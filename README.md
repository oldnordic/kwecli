# KWECLI - Knowledge Workflow Engine CLI

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PROTOTYPE STATUS - NON-FUNCTIONING

This repository contains a **prototype/experimental implementation** of KWECLI (Knowledge Workflow Engine CLI) that is currently **NON-FUNCTIONING** and under active development.

### Current Status
- üî¥ **Not ready for production use**
- üî¥ **Many components are incomplete or experimental**
- üî¥ **No guarantee of functionality**
- üî¥ **Breaking changes expected frequently**

## What is KWECLI?

KWECLI is an experimental autonomous development CLI tool that aims to provide:

- **Autonomous Code Generation**: AI-powered code generation using local models (Ollama)
- **Advanced LTMC Integration**: Native integration with Long-Term Memory Core systems
- **Sprint Management**: Project management with sprint planning and coordination
- **Code Drift Detection**: Automated detection of code inconsistencies and documentation drift
- **Multi-System Coordination**: Orchestration of multiple AI agents and tools

## Architecture Overview

The project contains several experimental components:

### Core Components
- `kwecli/` - Main CLI application package
- `bridge/` - Native LTMC integration bridge
- `start_kwe_cli.py` - Main entry point (experimental)

### Key Features (Experimental)
- **Native LTMC Bridge**: Direct integration with LTMC tools without MCP overhead
- **Advanced Service Layer**: Sprint management, code drift detection, blueprints
- **Autonomous Development**: Natural language command processing
- **Local AI Integration**: Ollama-based code generation

### Supporting Systems
- `agents/` - AI agent coordination system
- `tools/` - Various utility tools
- `config/` - Configuration management
- `frontend/` - Web interface components (experimental)

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Ollama (for local AI models)
- LTMC system (Long-Term Memory Core)
- Various Python dependencies

## Installation

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This is prototype code and may not work as expected**

```bash
# This is experimental - use at your own risk
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kwecli.git
cd kwecli
# Installation process is not yet standardized
```

## Usage

**‚ö†Ô∏è This software is not functional yet**

The intended usage would be:
```bash
python start_kwe_cli.py -c "your development command"
```

But this is currently non-functional and experimental.

## Development Status

This is an active prototype with the following experimental areas:

- AI-powered autonomous development workflows
- Multi-database coordination (Neo4j, Redis, SQLite, FAISS)
- Sprint management and project coordination
- Code generation with local language models
- Documentation synchronization systems
