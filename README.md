# KWECLI - Knowledge Workflow Engine CLI

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PROTOTYPE STATUS - NOT PRODUCTION READY ‚ö†Ô∏è

This repository contains a **prototype/experimental implementation** of KWECLI (Knowledge Workflow Engine CLI) for research and development purposes only.

### Current Status
- üü° **Prototype functionality achieved** - 3-phase enhancement complete
- üî¥ **Not ready for production use**
- üü° **Research/development testing successful**
- üî¥ **No guarantee of production stability**
- üî¥ **Breaking changes expected frequently**

## What is KWECLI?

KWECLI is an experimental autonomous development CLI tool that aims to provide:

- **Autonomous Code Generation**: AI-powered code generation using local models (Ollama)
- **Advanced LTMC Integration**: Native integration with Long-Term Memory Core systems
- **Sprint Management**: Project management with sprint planning and coordination
- **Code Drift Detection**: Automated detection of code inconsistencies and documentation drift
- **Multi-System Coordination**: Orchestration of multiple AI agents and tools

## Architecture Overview

The project contains several experimental components:

### Core Components
- `kwecli/` - Main CLI application package
- `bridge/` - Native LTMC integration bridge
- `start_kwe_cli.py` - Main entry point (experimental)

### Key Features (Experimental)
- **Native LTMC Bridge**: Direct integration with LTMC tools without MCP overhead
- **Advanced Service Layer**: Sprint management, code drift detection, blueprints
- **Autonomous Development**: Natural language command processing
- **Local AI Integration**: Ollama-based code generation

### Supporting Systems
- `agents/` - AI agent coordination system
- `tools/` - Various utility tools
- `config/` - Configuration management
- `frontend/` - Web interface components (experimental)

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Ollama (for local AI models)
- LTMC system (Long-Term Memory Core)
- Various Python dependencies

## Installation

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This is prototype code and may not work as expected**

```bash
# This is experimental - use at your own risk
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kwecli.git
cd kwecli
# Installation process is not yet standardized
```

## Usage

**‚ö†Ô∏è This software is not functional yet**

The intended usage would be:
```bash
python start_kwe_cli.py -c "your development command"
```

But this is currently non-functional and experimental.

## Prototype Development Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Experimental Features (3-Phase Enhancement)

**Phase 1 - Semantic Routing Intelligence:**
- Intelligent query classification and database routing
- Sub-millisecond routing decisions
- Native LTMC integration

**Phase 2 - Quality Evaluation System:**  
- 6 comprehensive quality evaluation metrics
- 99.56% performance improvement (35s ‚Üí 155ms)
- Real-time feedback loops

**Phase 3 - Retrieval Refinement:**
- 4 advanced retrieval strategies (HyDE, Fusion, Rerank, Contextual)
- Multi-source context optimization
- Sub-15ms processing performance

### üìä Prototype Performance Metrics

| Component | Target | Achieved | Status |
